# Privacy-First Password Generator

A client-side only password generator built with Next.js that creates secure passwords while respecting user privacy. All password generation happens directly in the browser - no data is ever sent to a server.

## üîê Features

- **Privacy-first approach** - 100% client-side processing with no server communication
- **Two password types**:
  - **Strong passwords** - Alphanumeric passwords generated with special characters (e.g., `xufdud-jitdyv-hosMe3`)
  - **Normal passwords** - Same as above but without any special characters (e.g., `twekKZPGqzg6ZYi`)
- **Customizable special characters** - Define up to 2 special characters to use in your strong passwords
- **Copy to clipboard** - One-click copying of generated passwords
- **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **No data storage** - Passwords are generated on demand and never stored
